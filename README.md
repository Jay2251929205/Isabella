:green_heart:

My name is Isabella Kroon. I am a sophomore student at Duke Kunshan University, majoring in Computation and Design with a track in Social Policy and an Environmental Sustainability concentration. I'm interested in how statistics and computation can be used to understand environmental issues and inform environmental policy.
